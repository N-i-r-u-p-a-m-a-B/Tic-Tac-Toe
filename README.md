## 🎮 How to Play

* The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
* Players take turns to place their marker (`X` or `O`) on the grid.
* Enter the row and column index (0, 1, or 2) when prompted.
* The first player to align 3 markers horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
* If all 9 cells are filled with no winner, it's a draw.
